# React-ToDo-App
A React application where we can add new ToDo's. 
There are a few ways to filter ToDo's - we can search by text or we can show completed ToDo's as well. 
Here it can be seen that how we can work with real world data persisting at the browser &amp; saving it in a third party service, so someone can login from any browser and continue where he left off.
